# Rectangle Placement Problem

This project solves the problem of placing five random rectangles in a 100x100 unit space using **Recursive Partitioning (Divide and Conquer)**. The solution ensures that the rectangles:
- Do not overlap,
- Have a separation of 1 unit,
- Can be rotated if necessary, 
- And, if no valid placement is possible, it raises an error.

## Problem Statement

The task is to:
1. Choose five rectangles of random width and height.
2. Place these rectangles optimally in a 100x100 space while minimizing the solution area.
3. Ensure that:
   - Rectangles do not overlap and have a separation of at least 1 unit.
   - Rectangles can be rotated (width and height can be swapped).
   - Sorting of rectangles beforehand is not allowed.
   - If placement is not possible, an error should be generated.

## Approach

### Recursive Partitioning (Divide and Conquer)
- The space (100x100) is divided into smaller subregions, and each rectangle is placed recursively within these regions.
- If a rectangle does not fit in the current region, the algorithm attempts to rotate the rectangle (swap width and height).
- If neither the original nor rotated rectangle fits, the space is further divided until a valid placement is found or an error is raised.

### Steps
1. **Random Rectangle Generation**: The program generates five rectangles with random widths and heights between 10 and 30 units.
2. **Space Partitioning**: The space is recursively split into smaller regions after each successful rectangle placement.
3. **Rotation Handling**: If a rectangle does not fit, it is rotated and placed if possible.
4. **Error Handling**: If no valid placement is possible, an error is raised.
5. **Plotting**: The placed rectangles are visualized using `matplotlib` to demonstrate the final solution.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `matplotlib` library for plotting the rectangles.

### Install `matplotlib`:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Rectangle-Placer-Python.git
cd Rectangle-Placer-Python
```

2. Run the Python script:

```bash
python rectangle_placer.py
```

3. After execution, the program will display a plot showing the rectangles placed optimally in the 100x100 unit space.

## Example Output

Here is an example of the rectangle placement plot generated by the program:

## Code Overview

### `RectanglePlacer` Class
- **`generate_random_rectangles(self, num_rectangles)`**: Generates random width and height for the given number of rectangles.
- **`place_rectangles(self, space, rectangles)`**: Uses recursive partitioning to place rectangles in the given space.
- **`can_place_rectangle(self, space, width, height)`**: Checks if a rectangle can be placed in the current space.
- **`split_space(self, space, width, height)`**: Splits the available space into two subregions.
- **`plot_rectangles(self)`**: Plots the placed rectangles using `matplotlib`.

### Error Handling
If the placement of the rectangles is not possible due to the space constraints, the program will raise an error: 
```
ValueError: Placement not possible with the given constraints.
```
